# NUS IGEM 2019 EcoGrow
A powerful software tool that simulates bacterial growth without running experiments in the wet lab.
##### Software currently doesn't support MacOS
# Installation
## Windows Packaged Installation (Recommended):
1. Go to Releases and download then run EcoGrow_Vx_PackagedInstallation.exe.
2. Follow the installation steps.
3. Once the installation is complete, run EcoGrow.exe from the start menu.
4. A loading screen will appear and may disappear. Rest assured this means the software is booting.
5. A UI_Figure Window will popup containing the software GUI. Please wait for the whole window to be booted (This can be seen by the Ready sign, and the left hand tabs are populated)

***6. If resizing errors occur, this is because the window needs to booted.***
***Please restart the EcoGrow.exe and wait one minute after the window appears.*** 

7. After the software has launched please read the welcome guide before using the program. 
8. Enjoy long living bacteria!

# User Guide
21/10/2019 Supports SgrS, HicA-HicB and Surface Plot

Our E.co Grow software allows users to run hundreds of simulations in order to gain useful insights without carrying out elaborate experiments. The foundation of this software lies in our models of the HicA-HicB and SgrS systems which have been built using our characterization data. On the basis of a few inputs specified by users, our software can predict bacterial growth trends and offer experimental design recommendations to suit their purpose. By harnessing the power of modelling, our software aims to effectively reduce the number of experiments carried out by the wet lab to test and optimise the system.
